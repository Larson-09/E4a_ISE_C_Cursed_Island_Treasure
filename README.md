# Cursed Island Treasure

This is a little game that I made during my computer science studies as part of the C programming language course.

## Rules
The objective is to find the treasure that is hide on the cursed island (the grid).

## Controls
Use the hotkeys `ZQSD` to move through the grid. If you want to leave, press `E`.
You can change theses hotkeys as well as other parameters of the game in the configuration file (`conf.c`)

## Launch
To launch the game, use the following command : `./CursedIslandTreasure`.
